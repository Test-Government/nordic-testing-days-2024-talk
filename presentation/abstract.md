# You MUST NOT use Postman for test automation according to RFC-9225

Take a peek behind the testing curtain of Estonian authentication and digital signature services - ID-card, Mobile-ID,
Smart-ID, Central authentication(TARA) and authorisation systems, SiGa, SiVa, etc.

I will relive my decade long journey of refactoring and incremental evolution from monoliths and SoapUI to tightly
coupled microservices with Spock.

There will be memes from 2001, KISSing, lots of code, a few rants and hopefully a mental framework on how to tackle any
automation project.

Main takeaways:

* Good and bad patterns for test automation code - Object Mother, Excel Roller Coaster
* Test automation architecture and why you shouldn't have one - I will even give you mine for free
* What is a test environment and also why you shouldn't have one - Why I'm now a part time DevOps engineer
* How to integrate test reports into software development workflow - Specification by Example for real this time
* Guiding principles that have shaped our decisions and should be universal for all projects
