# 2015 negative modulus

250 000 ID-Cards not working with Chrome

According to ASN.1 DER encoding, integers are encoded using two’s
complement representation interpreting the most significant bit as a sign bit. This
requires positive integer values that have the most significant bit of the most
significant byte set to be zero-padded. The ID card certificates were encoded
ignoring this requirement.

Negative modulus:

Failure to revoke ID card certificates of deceased cardholders
---

Once a day, an information system run by the IT and Development Centre at the
Estonian Ministry of the Interior (SMIT) sends requests to SK to revoke the
affected certificates. According to PPA, from 2014 to mid-2015 the data was
submitted to the SK information system using incorrect request parameters and
this resulted in an error. As the data exchange was not monitored on either side,
the error was only discovered in the middle of 2015.

The Chancellor of Justice concluded that if a person had suffered damage, it is
possible to apply for compensation from PPA under the State Liability Act

My biases in 2015
---

# Python - RobotFramework

# Java - Fit/FitNesse

<!-- end_slide -->

Environment
---

* Monolithic application (modules)
* SSH to VM, modify configuration, test, leave
* Ask in chat if you can take CA, remote desktop into Windows, do your changes, export XML to git
* Jenkins builds and deploys WAR to VM, restart Tomcat, run tests
* Oracle Database
* Commercial CA software running on Windows

<!-- end_slide -->

Tests overview
---

# SoapUI

* Tests are flaky and hard to maintain
* Couple of thousand test cases
* Each with ~20 steps
* Responses with ~10 assertions
* Groovy scripts copy-pasted

<!-- end_slide -->

Test evolution
---

# Trapped in a tool

Never enough time to move to a better tool, always dealing with daily problems

# Java Unit tests in new project

# Groovy library from SoapUI with Groovy tests in new module

# Waiting for old projects to die

<!-- end_slide -->

Creative solutions to stupid problems
---

# Branches are free, merging is a problem

## Split up QA engineers across modules and projects

# Refactoring in SoapUI

## Use tests as methods

## Python script to find TestSuite/TestCase/Step/(Assertion) where occurrence is found

# Code duplications

## Groovy library for common utilities - generating person

## Requires restarting SoapUI to load new library version

# Best Current Practises

* Git MUST be the single source of truth
    - Merge conflicts are resolvable
    - Immutable environments are stored in git
    - No "blobs" in pull requests and code reviews
    - State is repeatable from a tag
* Everybody MUST have their own test environment
* Test environments MUST work offline
* Out of the Box Experience MUST be prioritised over CI considerations
* Everything MUST be open source and replaceable
* Test data MUST NOT be hidden
* Requirements MUST have unique identifiers
* There SHOULD be a maximum of 5 E2E tests
